So I still bought 12X , although the cost - effective is not high , but I have no choice .
I bought the Realme Master Exploration edition , and I feel the cost - effective of it is better than 12X .
I am also tangled in the Master Exploration and 12X [ Yun Bei ] . I heard that the Master Explorer has poor performance in battery life and heating in the 870 model .
I just got it today , I used to use Apple before , I am marvel that Android has improved now . As for the heating and battery life compared to other mobile phones , it is not clear since I did n't compare them . But the appearance of the Master Exploration is really good , I bought the travel box edition .
I went to the store to experience it . The 12 did n't stuck at all when taking photo , and there was no delay . But the 12x did n't work .
I want to buy 12 because of the speed of taking pictures , but I am afraid that the battery life will not work , and it will heat up . I do n't play games [ eat melon ]
Buy it . Anyway , it can be replaced after a year . It is still possible for workers to work hard . No matter how bad it is , the Xiaomi Mi 12 series is more advanced than the Xiaomi Note with Snapdragon 810 , so buy it if you like it , and return it if it is not suitable . Return , then buy another [ hee hee ]
There are a lot of 870/865 mobile phones at the price of 2000 + . You can buy this thing for more than 3000 unless you are really fascinated by the small screen .
Yes , I really just need a small screen . To be honest , I would rather spend 1000 more for the small screen with the same configuration .

10u charging can greatly alleviate the impact of battery wear and tear , and the camera 's functional performance covers the gap brought about by the advancement of camera standards . I am also optimistic about 10u . Because the new Xiaomi serials , which are good than it , are not light .
According to their feedback , the performance and charging of 10u have weakened after Xiaomi updated the system , and the charging weakened even more severely .
The charging is indeed worse than before , but taking pictures is still the first echelon

The main oleophobic layer has a lifespan of friction times . If the film is not applied for a long time , the back of the screen will become more and more astringent , and the part will become more and more astringent .
Yes , but I think the film affects the look and feel , and the film scratches more easily than the screen .
It does n't matter if the film is scratched . If the screen is scratched , the second - hand price of the 13pro I use is at least 300 lower ( slight scratches ) . And the oleophobic layer will disappear quickly without the film , and it feels very uncomfortable . The shell can be omitted , but the film must not be attached . In comparison , more than 20 films are much cheaper

Tangled one plus 10pro , IQOO9pro , Realme , gt2pro [ allow sad ] , can the blogger analyze which one is better to choose , [ tears ]
Realme 's gt2Pro performance scheduling is very aggressive this time , which is more radical than iQOO9Pro 's performance scheduling . You can consider it if you play games or you are like straight - screen . The iQOO9Pro is the most balanced , and the OnePlus 10Pro has a good photo effect .

Among the three , OnePlus 10pro has the best image , iqoo9pro is the most like a bucket and has better performance scheduling . For Realme , it mainly depends on whether you like straight screen or not

I used Apple before , but now I have switched to Huawei . The biggest feeling is that Huawei 's battery is too durable . The game assistant that I do n't understand it , but there is a game mode when playing games .
My friend is also a Huawei mobile phone , and the 5 G battery life will last for more than a day
I have used Huawei and said I am not optimistic about it . If you do n't use your smartphone 's features a lot , Huawei phones are fine . His interface vision and office functions are very strong . ( But smart voice does n't seem to be very smart ) It looks like colors and lines , as well as optional themes and fonts
All are great and comfortable . Samsung does not recommend . Samsung is not so easy to use , it belongs to a regular brand , the other mobile phones have a prominent attribute , but Samsung is a pentagon warrior with every part score of 7.8 .
Oppo and vivo are very good in personalization , life and intelligence . It 's hard for me to say everything about oppo right now . It has a lot of similarities with vivo , but there are also differences . I just ca n't tell the difference now . For vivo , intelligent somatosensory operation , voice assistant information visualization , small functions that are convenient for life , etc . are very practical .

In fact , Meizu is really excellent in many places , especially the small window experience is first - class , the photo and video experience is better than Huawei 's ( although the photo effect is average ) , and the motor experience [ laugh cry ]
Last year and today , a lot of manufacturers have customized linear motors , how big is the size and how strong the performance is , but the actual experience is not as good as Meizu [ doge ]

At that time , compared with Android except Samsung , other domestic flagships , there was really no one that could fight . Samsung 's note8 at that time did not have much advantage even in terms of hardware , and was in a state of squeezing toothpaste .

What do you mean ? What you said as if Mi fans are offbeat , what 's wrong with them knowing cell phones ? What 's wrong with them being a little smarter than others ?
They are not the same consumer group . Huawei 's philosophy for consumers is that they have a long service cycle , fewer problems , and peace of mind . Xiaomi 's philosophy is to repair the WiFi when it burns , and replace the battery when it fails . Mi fans like to toss , and the more toss , the more they understand the phone . However , in the eyes of consumers who do not understand mobile phones , these problems are the performance of bad mobile phone .
Hahahaha , mixed use of flash memory , no oleophobic layer , green screen , our Huawei usage cycle is really too long !
It has long been mixed , and now it is the originator .
It 's not that Huawei ca n't peak charging . Is it difficult for Huawei ? Their strategy is to increase the charging speed as much as possible under the premise of prioritizing the protection of battery life . And Xiaomi 's strategy is that the charging speed is more important than the service life of the battery , it is cheaper to replace the battery anyway .
Do n't solicit troll , the charging speed does not affect the battery life , and what impact the battery life is charging when heating . I used this P40P for a year . I never played the game and the battery was also not good . The power dropped quickly . The charging speed at 40W was the same as the 22.5W speed . According to you , I have no experience to protect the battery nor the fast charging . What did I enjoy ?

If let me say , if nothing else happens , the Honor should be the fastest charging , taking pictures should be ok , and the heat dissipation should be the best . After all , the 7 nm chip plus the water cooling tube released by Honor some time ago will definitely be used for this . The price is estimated to be over 4000
But ... but the 980 is fortunately not able to still need to be worried , not to mention gt , ct , gimmicks , short - term high - frequency operation improves performance regardless of heat and battery life
Do n't talk nonsense without experience , gt is really strong

There is no doubt , the p20pro is already more than 4000 , and the 980 is used , how can it not exceed 4000 ?

Do you believe in OnePlus 's improvement ? Facts have proved that without sufficient funds and manpower , without good direction , it is difficult to become the best . Xiaomi , OnePlus , and Oppo are all like this . Only Apple , which is released once a year , is relatively perfect . Even Huawei ca n't perfectly complete a machine ( there is no new machine for two years , the old machine is well )
Am I the only one who thinks that Huawei 's phones are not good quality ? Plus , OnePlus also releases three or four models a year . They 're just separated , so it wo n't squeeze out so much at once . Is n't Apple 's mini promix also 4 models , like a sow all of a sudden ? And Apple also has tablet and host , a series of peripheral products , Apple not only makes mobile phones , and although there is a gap with Apple , Huawei is also chasing ducks . You go and see when it was released before , add the Honor is almost 30
Honor of this quality is not within the discussion range of online netizens , it is not worthy of

This is true , Huawei 's system is not very good , the operation is not very smooth
I have never used Xiaomi , my Honor 9 is still smooth after using it for more than 2 years , but I could n't help but change it to Honor 20 when the full screen came out .
I have a P10 , it does n't shut down for a few days when I do n't use it very much , and it freezes without much apps installed . Your Honor 9 is similar in configuration to it , and it 's probably not much better . It may also be that your standards for the smoothness of your phone are a bit low .
I changed it a year ago . Anyway , I never got stuck when I play eating chicken . It 's been two years , and it has n't been turned off for two years .
Huawei is not smooth ? Is the underlying optimization better than Xiaomi ? MIUI focuses on personalization . Huawei focuses on smoothness . You only need to compare the size of the system to know . Xiaomi 's system firmware is half more than Huawei ' s. A bloated system will lead to various killing backgrounds , which must be supported by hardware

However , there are indeed many large borders for the thousand yuan machine . As for the price of the Honor x20 2k+ , I do n't know your " like that " means good or bad .
Honey , do n't brag any more , this year , there is no Redmi family border better than the k30pro , and each border can stop the aircraft carrier

There is absolutely no problem that the front appearance beat a number of high - end flagships . This year , redmi does not as pay attention to texture as the past two years . It is more or less likely to be squeezed by various plastic flagships of realme and iqoo and be forced to change the knife method . But the k40 game texture is really top
The workmanship of the two generations of k20p and k30p is completely no problem , and the workmanship is more than 3,000 level . Starting from the k40 , it castrated work configuration . Just to keep costs down with one set of molds . It has little effect on 1999 users , but has a great impact on the original 2999 users

It will be stuck in a year later
Hehe , have you used it ?
Xiaomi mix3 is too stuck
The mix3 has been used for a year and a half , except that the battery life is not very good . After upgrading MIUI12 , it is very smooth [ laugh but no words ] [ laugh but no words ] [ laugh but no words ] [ laugh but no words ]
I am holding the mi8 . From the first release to the present , it is updated to MIUI12 development version . It has been used for more than two years , and it still does not get stuck . You do n't know if you do n't use it , so do n't bb
Mi 8 is really easy to use , MIUI is my favorite ! 845 has no problem playing chicken games
It 's really easy to use , but the development version stopped updating immediately , it 's a pity [ allow sad ] [ allow sad ]
Shut up you cloud users , then I say that Huawei will be stuck after a month [ doge ]
Huawei system is also garbage in my eyes

3 is GN1 4 is 598
That light pressure is so good , definitely not 598 , I have it , matt old garbage
My iqoo5pro 's depress highlights is also rubbish
3 is 598 , 12 million pixels , only 598 four - in - one is 12 million
The point is that these 4 are almost the same even after quadbayer , the difference can be ignored
3 is overexposed to that extent , still gn1 ?

Bragging do not pay taxes
Go buy one and try it out and you 'll know , none of the current Android flagships can beat 13pm
Is the double standard interesting ? When Apple 's battery life was poor , you said that battery life and fast charging were not important . Now there is improvement , you just brag it on to the sky
No one has ever said that battery life is not important . Apple 's three major pain points , battery life , heating and signal , it has been solved two at once this year . The battery life is invincible . The energy consumption ratio is very high this year , basically not hot , but the signal is not very good .
Am I bragging , you will know if you buy one and use it yourself
Do your android means including Redmi a series ?
iPhone 13 promax is the world 's best battery life phone this year
