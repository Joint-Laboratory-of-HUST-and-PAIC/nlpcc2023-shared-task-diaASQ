# DiaASQ

This repository contains data and code for the first-place solution to the
nlpcc2023 shared task: DiaASQ. See the [project page](https://conasq.pages.dev/results) for more details.

Our solution is a modified version of [DiaASQ](https://github.com/unikcc/DiaASQ)

## Installation
To clone and install the repository, please run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joint-Laboratory-of-HUST-and-PAIC/nlpcc2023-shared-task-diaASQ.git
cd nlpcc2023-shared-task-diaASQ
conda create -n diaasq python=3.9 -y
conda activate diaasq

## Overview
The architecture of our model is shown below:

<img src="./res/fig_sample.png" width="50%" />
</center>
We modified the baseline in the following aspects:
+ We use the [MacBERT] for both English and Chinese.
+ The English version is transfered from the final Chinese weights to achieve cross-lingual transfer.
+ We modified the loss weigths to make the model more robust.
+ We replaced multi-view interaction with three consecutive multi-head attention modules.
+ Cross-validation is used to select the best model and ensemble the models.


## Requirements

The model is implemented using PyTorch. The versions of the main packages used in our experiments are listed below:ss

+ torch==2.0.1
+ transformers==4.29.1

Install the other required packages:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We recommend using conda python 3.9 for all experiments.

## Training and Evaluation

See [Recipe](./recipes/README.md) for more details.


## Model Usage
You can download the pretrained model from [Google dirve](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UoWxWCDS8kjBD6UUHPLZDzrY2aNZ-xeJ/view?usp=drive_link) and put it in [./recipes/en/model_fused_top3.tar](./recipes/en/model_fused_top3.tar) or [./zh/model_fused_top3.tar](./zh/model_fused_top3.tar).
You can do inference with the following command:

```bash
cd recipes
bash kfold_inference.sh zh
bash kfold_inference.sh en
bash extract_and_apply_rules.sh # optional step, apply rules, improvement uknown,
```
+ GPU memory requirements

| Dataset | Batch size | GPU Memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chinese | 1 |  11GB. |
| English | 1 | 11GB. |

In all our experiments, we use a single RTX 3090 12GB.
